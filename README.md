# Meremer
A fork of [Jo√£o Pedro Costa's](https://github.com/joaopscosta) project _[hikaru](https://github.com/joaopscosta/hikaru)_, which is in turn based on [Real Kana](https://realkana.com/). _Meremer_ is adapted for studying katakana in the context of the Aynu (Ainu) language. This is not at all intended for studying Japanese.
